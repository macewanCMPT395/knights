        <p>This project was an attempt to get dkobia's heatmap plugin to work with the main page map. It was done as a school project for CMPT 395 at MacEwan University, and was carried out by Katie Thompson, Shaun Yonkers, and Jordan Dykstra.</p>

<p>WHAT WE DID:
We added a heatmap layer type to ushahidi.js and modified main_js.php in the default theme to create and use it. As the heatmap requires the data to be modified from the standard data, we used the data manipulation from dkobia's heatmap to do so. We generated the map as a layer and used this to create a vector layer, which allowed the heatmap to toggle on and off, as it wouldn't do so as a non-vector layer.</p>

<p>POSSIBLE ADDITIONS:
Making this a plugin on its own, making this a separate theme, and general streamlining, fixes, and new features would be great projects using this code.</p>
