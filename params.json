{"name":"Knights","tagline":"We are the Knights who say Ni!","body":"GETTING STARTED:\r\n\r\nThis project was an attempt to get dkobia's heatmap plugin to work with the main page map. It was done as a school project for CMPT 395 at MacEwan University, and was carried out by Katie Thompson, Shaun Yonkers, and Jordan Dykstra.\r\n\r\n![](http://imgur.com/tHhrvmL)\r\n\r\nThe existing heatmap plugin - though useful - works by loading a separate page with a new map and heatmap. We wanted the user to be able to see the heatmap in a similar interface to the way the reports our shown. With our heatmap, the user can also view the heatmap and reports at the same time, which is not possible with the existing heatmap plugin.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nFor existing Ushahidi installations:\r\n- Replace the default ushahidi.js in media/js with the one from this project.\r\n- Replace the default main_js.php in themes/default/views/main with the one from this project.\r\n- Replace the default main.php in application/controllers with the one from this project.\r\n- Change the permissions for your installation to whatever allows it to function on your machine, in our case 755.\r\n\r\nFor new Ushahidi installations:\r\n- This project contains the entire default codebase for Ushahidi, so cloning the repository would be a functioning installation.\r\n\r\nDEVELOPERS:\r\n\r\nRepo:\r\nhttps://github.com/macewanCMPT395/knights\r\n\r\nWHAT WE DID:\r\nWe added a heatmap layer type to ushahidi.js, the heatmap controller code from dkobia's plugin to the main controller, and modified main_js.php in the default theme to create and use it. As the heatmap requires the data to be modified from the standard data, we used the data manipulation from dkobia's heatmap to do so. We generated the map as a layer and used this to create a vector layer, which allowed the heatmap to toggle on and off, as it wouldn't do so as a non-vector layer.\r\n\r\nFUTURE PLANS:\r\nCategory selection and associated redrawing would be the optimum \r\n\r\nPOSSIBLE ADDITIONS:\r\nMaking this a plugin on its own, making this a separate theme, and general streamlining, fixes, and new features would be great projects using this code.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
